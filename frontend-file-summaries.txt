  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global stylesheet defining the OKLCH-based design system with charcoal/cream/gold palette, Playfair Display + Inter + Cormorant Garamond typography, and utility classes for the minimalist-artistic atelier aesthetic including gold accents, ink dividers, upload drop zones, and animation helpers.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind configuration adding custom font families (Playfair Display serif, Cormorant Garamond, Inter sans), gold/ink color tokens, sharp border-radius variants, and artistic box-shadow utilities to support the fine-art visual theme.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root application component setting up TanStack Router with four routes (Home, HowItWorks, Contact, Results), a shared RootLayout with Header/Footer, ThemeProvider, and Sonner toast notifications.",
  "frontend/src/components/Header.tsx": "Fixed navigation header with HILSA-ART logo, desktop nav links with gold underline hover effects, a \"Start Creating\" CTA button, and a responsive mobile hamburger menu.",
  "frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx": "Site footer with brand description, navigation links, social media icons (Instagram, X, Behance), copyright year, and caffeine.ai attribution with UTM tracking.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx": "Home page updated to 4 stages throughout — hero stage pills (4 items), stage preview grid (2×2 layout with 4 cards and matching STAGE_CARD_STYLES/STAGE_IMAGES arrays), and all descriptive copy updated to reference four progressive pencil drawing stages.",
  "frontend/src/pages/HowItWorks.tsx": "How It Works page rebuilt with a 2×2 grid of four stage cards, each displaying the corresponding generated stage image (stage1-basic-construction through stage4-final-shaded), a Roman numeral step label (Step I–IV), a numeric badge (01–04), stage title, and description. The old tutorial grid preview section and previous card layout have been removed.",

  "frontend/src/components/UploadInterface.tsx": "Photo upload component with drag-and-drop, file validation, image preview, and upload progress — unchanged in behavior but kept consistent with the corrected hook types and route param naming.",
  "frontend/src/components/GalleryView.tsx": "Gallery component updated to 4 stages with a dual view mode (2×2 grid and individual cards). The grid view renders all four stage images in a 2×2 layout with hover-reveal download buttons, stage captions below each quadrant, and a \"Download Tutorial Grid\" button that uses the composited grid data URL. Switches to card view automatically while stages are still generating.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Results.tsx": "Results page that reads the route param as `id` (matching the `$id` route definition in App.tsx) instead of `jobId`, fixing the \"NO JOB ID PROVIDED\" error — all other logic for polling, gallery rendering, and error/loading states is preserved.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations — useJob (polling query), useMyJobs, useCreateJob, useProcessJob, and useRetryFailedJob mutations. Removed the useCancelJob hook since cancelJob does not exist on the backend interface.",
  "frontend/src/lib/pencilSketchUtils.ts": "Canvas-based pencil sketch pipeline reduced to exactly 4 stages (Basic Construction, Refined Line Art, Hair & Detail Development, Final Shaded Portrait) with updated STAGE_LABELS, STAGE_DESCRIPTIONS, and STAGES constants.
