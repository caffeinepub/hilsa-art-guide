{
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global stylesheet extended with new editorial paper design tokens (--paper, --paper-warm, --paper-rule, --graphite, --graphite-light) in OKLCH, plus utility classes (.bg-paper, .bg-paper-warm, .border-paper-rule, .text-graphite, .text-graphite-light, .bg-graphite, .text-paper, .sketch-stage-label) to support the warm cream pencil-sketch tutorial aesthetic across HowItWorks and GalleryView.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind config now includes paper (DEFAULT/warm/rule) and graphite (DEFAULT/light) color tokens mapped to the new OKLCH CSS variables, enabling direct use of bg-paper, bg-paper-warm, border-paper-rule, text-graphite, and text-graphite-light utility classes throughout the app.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root application component with TanStack Router now registering five routes (Home, HowItWorks, Docs, Contact, Results), shared RootLayout with Header/Footer, ThemeProvider, and Sonner toast notifications.",
  "frontend/src/components/Header.tsx": "Fixed navigation header updated to include a \"Docs\" link pointing to /docs in both the desktop nav array and the mobile hamburger menu, alongside the existing Home, How It Works, and Contact links.",
  "frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx": "Site footer updated to include a \"Docs\" link to /docs in the Navigation section alongside the existing Home, How It Works, and Contact links, maintaining consistent hover styling.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx": "Home page updated to 4 stages throughout — hero stage pills (4 items), stage preview grid (2×2 layout with 4 cards and matching STAGE_CARD_STYLES/STAGE_IMAGES arrays), and all descriptive copy updated to reference four progressive pencil drawing stages.",
  "frontend/src/pages/HowItWorks.tsx": "Completely redesigned How It Works page with a warm cream paper background, a 2×2 grid of the four pencil sketch stage images (using the new stage1-sketch through stage4-sketch assets) separated by thin graphite rule lines, Roman numeral overlays (I–IV) in muted serif font over each image, and small-caps Cormorant Garamond stage captions below — matching the reference tutorial image aesthetic with no card shadows or colored backgrounds.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Contact.tsx": "Contact page with validated form (name, email, message with error states), contact info cards, social media links, and a success confirmation state after submission.",
  "frontend/src/components/UploadInterface.tsx": "Photo upload component with drag-and-drop, file validation, image preview, and upload progress — unchanged in behavior but kept consistent with the corrected hook types and route param naming.",
  "frontend/src/components/GalleryView.tsx": "Gallery component updated to the warm cream editorial style — the 2×2 grid view uses thin paper-rule dividers instead of rounded card borders, Roman numeral overlays in muted graphite serif font on each stage image, small-caps Cormorant stage labels in the caption strip, and all toggle/button controls use the graphite/paper palette instead of stone/amber colors.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Results.tsx": "Results page that reads the route param as `id` (matching the `$id` route definition in App.tsx) instead of `jobId`, fixing the \"NO JOB ID PROVIDED\" error — all other logic for polling, gallery rendering, and error/loading states is preserved.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations — useJob (polling query), useMyJobs, useCreateJob, useProcessJob, and useRetryFailedJob mutations. Removed the useCancelJob hook since cancelJob does not exist on the backend interface.",
  "frontend/src/lib/pencilSketchUtils.ts": "Canvas-based pencil sketch pipeline reduced to exactly 4 stages (Basic Construction, Refined Line Art, Hair & Detail Development, Final Shaded Portrait) with updated STAGE_LABELS, STAGE_DESCRIPTIONS, and STAGES constants. Exports generatePencilSketchStages (4-stage progressive processing with v7 cache key) and a new generateTutorialGrid helper that composites all 4 stage images into a 2×2 grid canvas and returns a data URL.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Documentation.tsx": "Comprehensive Documentation page at /docs with seven sections — App Overview, How to Use (4-step guide), The Four Sketch Stages, Technical Architecture, Pages & Features, Contact & Support, and a new Backend API Reference section (section 07) covering all 11 subsections: Project Overview with architecture flow diagram and folder structure, Authentication endpoints (register/login with JSON examples), Image Upload API, AI Stage Generation System with a 5-stage table (Edge Detection through Final Artistic Render), Retrieve Stages endpoint, Feedback System endpoints, PDF Export endpoint, Security & Performance Layer (JWT, rate limiting, error format, queue, CDN), Database Models (User/Image/Stage/Feedback with field tables), Scalability Strategy, and Future Expansion. All new content uses the existing cream/gold design system with formatted code blocks, semantic tables, and anchor-based navigation."
