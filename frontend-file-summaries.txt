  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global stylesheet defining the OKLCH-based design system with charcoal/cream/gold palette, Playfair Display + Inter + Cormorant Garamond typography, and utility classes for the minimalist-artistic atelier aesthetic including gold accents, ink dividers, upload drop zones, and animation helpers.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind configuration adding custom font families (Playfair Display serif, Cormorant Garamond, Inter sans), gold/ink color tokens, sharp border-radius variants, and artistic box-shadow utilities to support the fine-art visual theme.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root application component setting up TanStack Router with four routes (Home, HowItWorks, Contact, Results), a shared RootLayout with Header/Footer, ThemeProvider, and Sonner toast notifications.",
  "frontend/src/components/Header.tsx": "Fixed navigation header with HILSA-ART logo, desktop nav links with gold underline hover effects, a \"Start Creating\" CTA button, and a responsive mobile hamburger menu.",
  "frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx": "Site footer with brand description, navigation links, social media icons (Instagram, X, Behance), copyright year, and caffeine.ai attribution with UTM tracking.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx": "Updated Home page with corrected stage names matching the new pipeline (Basic Outline → Clean Line Art → Refined Sketch → Detailed Shading → Finished Portrait) and a 5-card stage preview grid using the generated sketch-stage reference images with cream background, stage number overlays, and fallback image handling.",
  "frontend/src/pages/HowItWorks.tsx": "How It Works page updated with the five new pencil sketch technique stage names and artist-friendly descriptions — Light Hatching, Directional Strokes, Cross-Hatching & Detail, Graphite Shading, and Final Pencil Artwork — with detailed technical explanations of each drawing technique. The \"At a Glance\" section title updated to \"The Pencil Sketch Pipeline\" and the CTA copy updated to reference the pencil sketch transformation.",

  "frontend/src/components/UploadInterface.tsx": "Photo upload component with drag-and-drop, file validation, image preview, and upload progress — unchanged in behavior but kept consistent with the corrected hook types and route param naming.",
  "frontend/src/components/GalleryView.tsx": "Gallery component that renders the original uploaded image and all 5 pencil sketch stage outputs, updated to call `generatePencilSketchStages(uploadedImageSrc)` with a single argument (matching the updated utility API), then sets all stages at once on completion with session-storage caching. Preserves all existing lightbox, download, backend stage preference, and loading/error state logic.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Results.tsx": "Results page that silently redirects to home when no job ID is present, shows neutral loading/error/failed states without raw error strings, and renders GalleryView with the correct `uploadedImageSrc`, `jobId`, and `backendStages` props extracted from the job object.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations — fixes `useJob` to return `Job | null` (not `JobResponse | null`), fixes `useMyJobs` to return `Job[]`, and fixes `useProcessJob` to properly unwrap the `JobResponse` variant before returning the `Job` and using `job.id` in `onSuccess`.",
  "frontend/src/lib/pencilSketchUtils.ts": "Completely rewritten 5-stage pencil sketch pipeline with clearly progressive visual output — Stage 1 shows only barely-visible faint outlines (threshold ~210, opacity ~0.12, no hatching), Stage 2 adds light sparse single-direction hatching (threshold ~155, opacity ~0.32), Stage 3 introduces medium-density two-direction hatching with stronger edges (threshold ~125, opacity ~0.52), Stage 4 applies dense cross-hatching with three directions and high contrast (threshold ~88, opacity ~0.72), and Stage 5 delivers a fully detailed hand-drawn look with five hatching directions, S-curve tonal compression, graphite grain, paper texture, and vignette (threshold ~58, opacity ~0.90). All stages return canvas data URLs and maintain existing function signatures."
