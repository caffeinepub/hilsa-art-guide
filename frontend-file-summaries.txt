  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global stylesheet defining the OKLCH-based design system with charcoal/cream/gold palette, Playfair Display + Inter + Cormorant Garamond typography, and utility classes for the minimalist-artistic atelier aesthetic including gold accents, ink dividers, upload drop zones, and animation helpers.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind configuration adding custom font families (Playfair Display serif, Cormorant Garamond, Inter sans), gold/ink color tokens, sharp border-radius variants, and artistic box-shadow utilities to support the fine-art visual theme.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root application component setting up TanStack Router with four routes (Home, HowItWorks, Contact, Results), a shared RootLayout with Header/Footer, ThemeProvider, and Sonner toast notifications.",
  "frontend/src/components/Header.tsx": "Fixed navigation header with HILSA-ART logo, desktop nav links with gold underline hover effects, a \"Start Creating\" CTA button, and a responsive mobile hamburger menu.",
  "frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx": "Site footer with brand description, navigation links, social media icons (Instagram, X, Behance), copyright year, and caffeine.ai attribution with UTM tracking.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx": "Updated Home page with corrected stage names matching the new pipeline (Basic Outline → Clean Line Art → Refined Sketch → Detailed Shading → Finished Portrait) and a 5-card stage preview grid using the generated sketch-stage reference images with cream background, stage number overlays, and fallback image handling.",

  "frontend/src/components/UploadInterface.tsx": "Photo upload component with drag-and-drop, file validation, image preview, and upload progress — navigates to /results/<jobId> immediately after createJob succeeds (with a valid non-empty jobId), then fires processJob in the background so the Results page can poll for status without waiting for the long-running update call to complete.",
  "frontend/src/components/GalleryView.tsx": "Rewritten gallery component displaying the original photo plus all 5 sketch stages in a 2-column grid with per-stage loading spinners, completion badges, download buttons, and a full-screen lightbox with keyboard navigation — prefers backend v3 StageResult images when available and falls back to client-side canvas generation with a progress bar.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Results.tsx": "Updated Results page that always renders the GalleryView immediately (even during pending/inProgress backend states) so client-side sketch generation starts right away, with a status badge showing backend processing state and seamless replacement of client-side images with backend results as they complete.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations — includes an explicit `isValidJobId` guard in `useJob` to prevent polling when jobId is null/undefined, and a post-response validation in `useCreateJob` that throws a descriptive error if the returned jobId is missing.",
  "frontend/src/lib/pencilSketchUtils.ts": "Completely rewritten canvas-based pencil sketch pipeline producing 5 progressive stages matching the reference portrait style — Stage 1 (faint basic outline ~12% opacity), Stage 2 (clean line art ~30%), Stage 3 (refined sketch with hair shading ~48%), Stage 4 (directional hatching ~68%), Stage 5 (finished portrait with rich dark hair ~90%) — all rendered on warm cream/parchment (#f0ece0) background with deterministic paper grain texture and graphite pencil color blending."
