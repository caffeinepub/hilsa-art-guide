  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global stylesheet defining the OKLCH-based design system with charcoal/cream/gold palette, Playfair Display + Inter + Cormorant Garamond typography, and utility classes for the minimalist-artistic atelier aesthetic including gold accents, ink dividers, upload drop zones, and animation helpers.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind configuration adding custom font families (Playfair Display serif, Cormorant Garamond, Inter sans), gold/ink color tokens, sharp border-radius variants, and artistic box-shadow utilities to support the fine-art visual theme.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root application component setting up TanStack Router with four routes (Home, HowItWorks, Contact, Results), a shared RootLayout with Header/Footer, ThemeProvider, and Sonner toast notifications.",
  "frontend/src/components/Header.tsx": "Fixed navigation header with HILSA-ART logo, desktop nav links with gold underline hover effects, a \"Start Creating\" CTA button, and a responsive mobile hamburger menu.",
  "frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx": "Site footer with brand description, navigation links, social media icons (Instagram, X, Behance), copyright year, and caffeine.ai attribution with UTM tracking.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx": "Updated Home page with corrected stage names matching the new pipeline (Basic Outline → Clean Line Art → Refined Sketch → Detailed Shading → Finished Portrait) and a 5-card stage preview grid using the generated sketch-stage reference images with cream background, stage number overlays, and fallback image handling.",
  "frontend/src/pages/HowItWorks.tsx": "How It Works page updated with the five new pencil sketch technique stage names and artist-friendly descriptions — Light Hatching, Directional Strokes, Cross-Hatching & Detail, Graphite Shading, and Final Pencil Artwork — with detailed technical explanations of each drawing technique. The \"At a Glance\" section title updated to \"The Pencil Sketch Pipeline\" and the CTA copy updated to reference the pencil sketch transformation.",

  "frontend/src/components/UploadInterface.tsx": "Photo upload component with drag-and-drop, file validation, image preview, and upload progress — unchanged in behavior but kept consistent with the corrected hook types and route param naming.",
  "frontend/src/components/GalleryView.tsx": "Gallery component updated to use the progress callback from `generatePencilSketchStages` for progressive per-stage rendering (each card updates as its stage finishes), uses a `useRef` guard to prevent duplicate runs, shows Skeleton placeholders while loading, and displays all 5 stages in a responsive 1→2→5 column grid with download buttons and a lightbox.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Results.tsx": "Results page with clean error states — no raw error strings exposed; missing job ID shows a friendly \"No sketch job found\" message with a home link, backend errors show a neutral retry/home UI, failed jobs show a user-friendly message, and successful jobs render the GalleryView with a \"Create Another Sketch\" footer link.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations — fixes `useJob` to return `Job | null` (not `JobResponse | null`), fixes `useMyJobs` to return `Job[]`, and fixes `useProcessJob` to properly unwrap the `JobResponse` variant before returning the `Job` and using `job.id` in `onSuccess`.",
  "frontend/src/lib/pencilSketchUtils.ts": "Optimized 5-stage pencil sketch pipeline that computes grayscale and Sobel edges only once, pre-blurs at multiple radii (r1/r2/r3) and reuses them across all stages, yields to the browser between each stage via `setTimeout(0)`, and exposes a `StageProgressCallback` so stages render progressively as they complete. Downscales input to max 600px for speed."
