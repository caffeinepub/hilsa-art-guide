  "frontend/src/components/Header.tsx": "Fixed navigation header with HILSA-ART logo, desktop nav links with gold underline hover effects, a \"Start Creating\" CTA button, and a responsive mobile hamburger menu.",
  "frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx": "Site footer with brand description, navigation links, social media icons (Instagram, X, Behance), copyright year, and caffeine.ai attribution with UTM tracking.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx": "Home page with hero section, upload interface, and a 5-card stage preview grid updated to show the portrait drawing tutorial stages: Skull Construction, Head Structure, Feature Blocking, Light Detail, and Completed Portrait — with matching instructional descriptions for each step.",

  "frontend/src/pages/Results.tsx": "Results page that reads the route param as `id` (matching the `$id` route definition in App.tsx) instead of `jobId`, fixing the \"NO JOB ID PROVIDED\" error — all other logic for polling, gallery rendering, and error/loading states is preserved.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations — fixes `useJob` to return `Job | null` (not `JobResponse | null`), fixes `useMyJobs` to return `Job[]`, and fixes `useProcessJob` to properly unwrap the `JobResponse` variant before returning the `Job` and using `job.id` in `onSuccess`.",
