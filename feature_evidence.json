      "featureTitle": "Update the client-side pencil sketch pipeline in `frontend/src/lib/pencilSketchUtils.ts` to produce output that closely matches the reference image style: clean, thin graphite-grey outlines on a pure white background for Stage 1 (Basic Outline), with each subsequent stage progressively adding deeper, denser shading — including directional hatching, cross-hatching, and rich graphite/charcoal-level dark fills by Stage 5. The final stage must have deep, high-contrast shadow regions (near-black in darkest areas) while preserving bright whites in highlights, giving the appearance of a fully shaded traditional pencil drawing.",
