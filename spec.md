# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the Drawing Guide on the Results page and the HowItWorks page to display each stage as a distinct card matching the reference screenshot style (white card, bold step title, description text, full-width rounded stage image).

**Planned changes:**
- Redesign the Results page Drawing Guide walkthrough so each of the five stages is rendered as its own white card with rounded corners on a light grey background, containing: a bold step title (e.g. "Step 1: Trace the Outlines"), an instructional body paragraph, and the processed stage image in a full-width rounded image container below the text.
- All five stage cards are displayed sequentially in a vertically scrollable layout (no pagination or hidden stages).
- Update the HowItWorks page timeline so each stage entry becomes a standalone card in the same style: bold step heading, descriptive body text, and a representative stage preview image below the text, arranged vertically.
- Typography uses large bold sans-serif for step titles and regular-weight body font for descriptions.
- Layout is responsive for both desktop and mobile.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can scroll through all five drawing stage cards one after another on both the Results page and HowItWorks page, with each stage clearly presented as a white card showing the step title, instructions, and the stage image — matching the reference screenshot style.
