# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the HowItWorks page tutorial section with four new pencil-style stage illustrations of a female portrait, updating both the images and the stage card layout.

**Planned changes:**
- Generate four new stage illustration images (stage1-basic-construction, stage2-refined-lineart, stage3-hair-detail, stage4-final-shaded) depicting a female portrait progressing through pencil drawing stages
- Replace the existing tutorial section on the HowItWorks page (/how-it-works) with a new 4-card layout using these images
- Each card displays a Roman numeral step label (Step I–IV), numeric badge (01–04), stage title, and description
- Remove old/conflicting tutorial section code

**User-visible outcome:** The HowItWorks page shows four visually consistent pencil-drawing stage cards — from basic construction lines to a fully shaded graphite portrait — replacing the previous layout.
