  "summary": "The diff implements the HowItWorks page layout changes (REQ-2) correctly, with a 2×2 grid of stage cards showing Roman numerals, numeric badges, stage titles, descriptions, and references to the four generated images. However, the actual PNG image files (REQ-1) are not present in the diff — no files were added under frontend/public/assets/generated/, meaning the four required static image assets were not generated or committed.",

      "reason": "The diff shows 0 added files and no binary/image assets were added. The ADDED FILES section is explicitly 'none'. The HowItWorks.tsx references these image paths but the actual PNG files do not appear to have been committed.",
