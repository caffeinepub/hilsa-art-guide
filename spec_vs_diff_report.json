The project_state.json records REQ-5 as 'pending' and the backend/main.mo appears to be the Version 37 code being restored/deployed. However, there is no evidence in the diff of actual deployment steps (e.g., dfx deploy commands, CI/CD configuration, canister ID updates, or deployment scripts) that would confirm Version 37 was actually built and deployed to the Internet Computer network.",
