  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-11 and REQ-12. GalleryView.tsx is redesigned as a vertical stack of white rounded cards with bold step headings, description text, and full-width stage images. HowItWorks.tsx is redesigned with the same card-per-step layout on a light cream background. Both changes align with the acceptance criteria. No files under frontend/src/hooks/ or frontend/src/components/ui/ were modified.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "HowItWorks cards include an extra 'detail' text field (technique detail paragraph) beyond what was requested — each card shows three text blocks: stage description, plus an additional technique detail paragraph not present in the original requirements.",
      "reason": "REQ-12 specifies only a bold heading, body description text, and a representative image per card. The diff adds a third text block (stage.detail) with additional technique guidance not mentioned in the requirements or acceptance criteria.",
