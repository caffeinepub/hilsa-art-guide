  "summary": "The diff addresses both REQ-1 and REQ-2. REQ-1 is fully implemented: Results.tsx now silently redirects to home when no job ID is present and renders null during redirect, with no 'NO JOB ID PROVIDED' string anywhere. REQ-2 is partially addressed: no 'EXPECTED V3 RESPONSE' string appears in Results.tsx, and the file-summaries mention useQueries.ts was updated to properly unwrap JobResponse variants. However, the diff does not show the actual content of useQueries.ts to confirm 'EXPECTED V3 RESPONSE' was removed from that file.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Remove or suppress the 'EXPECTED V3 RESPONSE' error message from the UI — replace any occurrence with a neutral fallback message or silent error handling.",
      "reason": "The diff does not include the actual content of frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts, only a summary describing it was fixed. There is no direct evidence in the diff that the 'EXPECTED V3 RESPONSE' string was removed or replaced from useQueries.ts or any other file. The file-summary mentions 'fixes useJob to return Job | null' and 'properly unwrap the JobResponse variant', which is consistent with the fix, but no code-level proof is visible.",
