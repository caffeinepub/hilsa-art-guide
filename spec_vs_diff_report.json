  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) appear to be implemented in the diff. The pencilSketchUtils.ts has been optimized with shared grayscale/Sobel computation and per-stage blur radii. GalleryView.tsx has been updated with progressive stage rendering, skeleton placeholders, responsive grid, download buttons, and stage labels/subtitles. Results.tsx suppresses raw error strings and shows friendly fallback messages. No significant missing requirements or hallucinated features were identified.",
