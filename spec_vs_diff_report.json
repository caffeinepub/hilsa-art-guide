  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be substantially implemented. The pencilSketchUtils.ts has been refactored with Sobel edge detection, hatching/cross-hatching pipeline across 5 stages. The UI theme has been updated with deep near-black backgrounds, gold/amber accents, dark card containers, and proper HILSA-ART branding across all required pages and components. No significant missing requirements are detected, though a few unrequested features were added.",

      "description": "Social media links (Instagram, X/Twitter, Behance) added to Footer",
