Reduce processing time by: (1) running stage computations in a single canvas pass where possible, (2) reusing intermediate canvas buffers between stages instead of re-running grayscale/Sobel from scratch for each stage, (3) reducing Gaussian blur kernel radius for earlier stages (light stages need less blur), and (4) skipping cross-hatching and graphite shading computations entirely for stages 1–2.",
